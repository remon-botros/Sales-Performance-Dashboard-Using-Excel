# Sales-Performance-Dashboard-Using-Excel
Built a Sales Performance Dashboard in Excel using the Superstore Sales Dataset (Kaggle). Data was cleaned and organized, then analyzed with pivot tables to track revenue, units sold, and monthly trends. Added clear charts plus bonus features: slicers by region/category and YoY or MoM growth.
